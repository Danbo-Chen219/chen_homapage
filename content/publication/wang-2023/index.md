abstract: Under the dual carbon goals in China, the transition to a net-zero carbon
  economy requires massive amounts of capital, which must be provided and facilitated
  by financial institutions. Yet, there are no unified, publicly available disclosures
  of the investment carbon footprint of Chinese financial institutions, leaving them
  facing great climate-related risks. Here we demonstrate that the aggregated financed
  emissions show an upward trend from 2015, and the investment portfolios are more
  exposed to carbon-intensive assets, based on the equity portfolios of China's 105
  fund firms. We further explore the decarbonization potential for fund firms and
  show that sustainability-aware fund firms are characterized by financed emission
  reductions and carbon efficiency gains. To fulfill sustainable investing, China's
  institutional investors should focus on investment allocations shifting to high-tech
  sectors and target the improvement of self-reported carbon emissions.
